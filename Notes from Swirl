## Dates and Times
Dates are represented by the 'Date' class and times are represented by the 'POSIXct' and 'POSIXlt' classes. 
Internally, dates are stored as the number of days since 1970-01-01 and times are stored as either 
the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 (for 'POSIXct') or a list of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. (for 'POSIXlt').
