## General Rules for Keeping Code Clean
    1. Always use text files/ text editor
    2. Indent your code
        - Improve readbaility and forces you to think about writing code
        - 8 space indent, 80 column margin 
    3. Limit the width of the code
    4. Limit the length of individual functions - one basic activity
        - If function is for 'reading the data' it should only do that function
        - Allows function to be written on a single page of code
        - Keep track of where bugs might be hiding - better able to debug

## Dates and Time in R
    1. Dates are represented by the Date CLASS
    2. Times are represented by the POSIXct of the POSIXlt CLASS
    3. Dates are stored as the number of days since 1970-01-01
    4. Times are stored internally as th enumber of secons since 1970-01-01
    
      ** Dates are stored as ojects of the Date CLASS
         x <- as.Date("1970-01-01")
         unclass(x)
         unclass(as.Date("1970-01-01")

      ** POSIX:is a family of family of standards for presenting dates and times
         POSIXct - times represented as large integers, useful for storing time in dataframe
              as.POSIXct(x)
         POSIXlt - stores the day of week, day of year, month, day of month
              as.POSIXlt(x)
                  weekdays() = day of week
                  months() = month name
                  quarters() = quarter in year
       ** strptime() = use if dates are written in a different format
              datestring <- (c("January 10, 2012")
              x<- strptime(datestrong, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")
              class(x)
              check ?strptime page for format
       ** Operations on Dates and Times
              Can use mathematical operations (+ and (-) mostlye
              Cannot mix POSIX types
              Plotting functions will recognize the date/time object - plots will change
   
      **Looking at Data
               ls() - lists the variable sin workspace
               class() - overall structure of data
               data.frame - (rows and columns) is how most data stored in R when using read.csv() or read.table()
               dim() - how many rows and columns ** number of rows (observations) number of columns (variables)
                    nrow() - see only the number of rows
                    ncol() - see only the number of columns
               object.size() - how much space the dataset is occupying in memory
               names() - returns the chacter vector of column names (variable names)
               head() - gives preview of the first six rows **can change it using head(x, 10)
               tail() - same as head, but previews the last six rows
               summary()
                        numeric data: displays min, 1st quintile, median, mean, 3rd quintile, and max
                        categorical data: displays number of times each value(level) occurs
               table() - shows how many times each value actually occurs **example table(dataset$variable)
               str() - combines may of the above functions into a concise summary, provides name, class, and preview
