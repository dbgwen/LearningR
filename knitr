## About knitr package in R
     - R package written by Yihui Xie, supports Rmarkdown, LaTeX, and HTML
    - knitr is good for manuals, technical documents, tutorials, reports, data pre-processing 
    - knitr is not good for long research articles, time-consunming computations, documents that require precise formatting
    - Reads and evaluates the code of a markdown file
    - RMarkdown file -> Markdown file (knitr) -> convert to html -> view in browser
    - Never edit the markdown or html file, only edit the Rmarkdown file
    - Can organize analysis by having a single document that integrates the code and data
    - Literate statistical programming - idea from Don Kuth 
        Text and code all in one place
        Code is alive - if code doesn't run then you know you have an error
        Can be difficult to edit if there is a lot of code
    - Save the raw dataset + pre-processing code
    - Save data in non-proprietary format
## Markdown
    - Simple, intuititve formatting elements
    - A simplified version of "markup" languages

## Using knitr in RStudio

   - Press Knit HTML - runs the Rcode in the Markdown file
   - knitr takes original rMarkdown document and processes it into a regular Markdown document - adds the result of the Rcode into the markdown file
   - Code in the code chunk will be echoed in the code chunks of the document
   - Process: .Rmd -> .md -> .html ##only edit the original Rmarkdown file
   - Making tables with "xtable" package library(xtable
   - Set global options
      results: "asis", "hide"
      echo: TRUE, FALSE
      Figures: fig.height, fig.width
      caching computations: cache=TRUE ##useful for complex code chunks
